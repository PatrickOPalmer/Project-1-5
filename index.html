            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Allow us to introduce Patrick Palmer, a down-to-earth musician and a 
                valued member of our ensemble in the production of "Sweeney Todd." 
                This marks Patrick's first step into the world of musical theatre, 
                but his musical journey has been a heartfelt one. He's had the 
                pleasure of contributing his talents to some unique musical acts, 
                including "Gallows Humor," known for their quirky and darkly comedic music, 
                and "Cutthroat Reef," a rollicking sea-shanty, pirate band.</p>
